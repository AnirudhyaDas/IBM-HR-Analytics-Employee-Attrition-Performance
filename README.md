# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance

## Overview

Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical concern for organizations, affecting both productivity and profitability. High attrition rates can result in increased costs for recruitment and training, disrupt team dynamics, and lead to the loss of institutional knowledge. This analysis aims to understand the patterns and factors leading to employee attrition by using clustering techniques to segment employees based on demographic, financial, and job-related characteristics. Through this unsupervised machine learning approach, we seek to uncover hidden patterns that contribute to attrition, providing actionable insights for better employee retention strategies.

## Project Objectives
1. Understand Current Turnover Rates: Analyze employee turnover rates by demographic factors like age, gender, job role, and department.
2. Identify Key Factors Influencing Turnover: Use data features such as job satisfaction, salary, and stock options to find correlations with attrition.
3. Build Predictive Models: Train machine learning models to predict employee attrition and optimize them using hyperparameter tuning.
