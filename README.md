# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance

## Overview

Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical concern for organizations, affecting both productivity and profitability. High attrition rates can result in increased costs for recruitment and training, disrupt team dynamics, and lead to the loss of institutional knowledge. This analysis aims to understand the patterns and factors leading to employee attrition by using clustering techniques to segment employees based on demographic, financial, and job-related characteristics. Through this unsupervised machine learning approach, we seek to uncover hidden patterns that contribute to attrition, providing actionable insights for better employee retention strategies.
